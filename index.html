      <p><strong>Umaru Musa Yar'Adua,</strong> nicknamed <i> Mr Rule of Law </i><strong>(born Aug. 16, 1951, Katsina, Nigeria—died May 5, 2010, Abuja),</strong> Nigerian politician who served as president of Nigeria (2007–10). His inauguration marked the first time in the country’s history that an elected civilian head of state had transferred power to another. <b>The late Yar'adua was nicknamed Mr Rule of Law because of his favourable disposition to the judiciary.</b> Under his administration, the ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP) lost states like Edo, Ondo, and Osun in court.</p>
